## Reflection

This was a multi day project that is used to showcase my current CSS and HTML skills on applying it to something that would have a real life use-case. Although using a framework such as react would make this project more realistic, I believe that focusing on fundamental web development using vanilla tools will be able to showcase my understanding of the fundamentals.
