Sample Admin Dashboard

This is a static webpage that has no functionality but a base dashboard layout created only using vanilla CSS and HTML.

This was a multi day project that is used to showcase my current CSS and HTML skills on applying it to something that would have a real life use-case. Although
using a framework such as react would make this project more usable in the backend, I believe that focusing on fundamental web development using vanilla tools
will be able to showcase my understanding of the fundamentals.
